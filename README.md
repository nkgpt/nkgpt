- 👋 Hi, I’m Nik, a freelance UX designer with occassional front-end tendencies.
- 👀 I’m really interested in user-centric (and thereby accessible) thematic UIs - the confluence of function and beauty. 
- 🌱 Currently learning how to deploy cost-effective JAMSTACK web apps with their own CMS. Having computing instances running the likes of WordPress and a plethora of plugins is madness.
- 💞️ Hit me up if you want to collaborate on any environmental projects, particularly ones that assist with animal welfare and climate change.
- 📫 The best place to reach me is on Twitter: @nkgpt
